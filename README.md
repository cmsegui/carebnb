Community BnB is a proof of concept... An Airbnb for displaced victims of natural disasters and the volunteers who'd like to put them up for free.  When I originally thought of this, I failed to realize the scope of what this application would be so this is definitely a 'rough sketch'.  <br>
For future development, I'd like to incorporate Google OAuth as a way to sign in securely and Google maps for searching.  I'd also like to continue building on to the home seekers side of the app.
<br>
My unsolved problems would include the lack of an external API as well as my edit button not responding correctly on the client side.
